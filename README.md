# 🐍 Python Diary

Welcome to my Python Diary! 📘  
This is where I practice and save all my Python learning exercises — from variables and loops to functions and more.

## 📚 Topics I'm Learning:
- ✅ Variables
- ✅ Data types
- ✅ Input/Output
- ⏳ Coming soon: Loops, Functions, Lists...

## 📁 Structure:
Each file is one small lesson:
- `day1_variables.py` → Practicing variables
- `day2_input.py` → Taking input from the user

## ✨ Why I'm Doing This:
I'm learning Python to become a data analyst. This diary helps me track my progress.

🔁 I'll keep updating this as I learn more!
